Task 2- Student Grade Calculator

Hi guys this is my second task in CodSoft internship. 

Student Grade Calculator (SGC) can be used to calculate a percentage based on the marks of students. We take input as marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject. Sum up the marks obtained in all subjects. Divide the total marks by the total number of subjects to get the average percentage.  Assign grades based on the average percentage achieved. Show the total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade to the user.

This task is also developed using Java programming and this too is very easy to operate and has a user friendly GUI.
