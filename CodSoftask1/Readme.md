Task 1- Number Guessing Game

Hi guys this my First task I did for CodSoft internship.

A number guessing game is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess a number between 0 and N. The game will continue until the user guesses the correct number.
It is a simple game developed using java programming, it has a user friendly Graphical User interface and anyone can play it.
